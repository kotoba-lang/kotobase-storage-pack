  "The recovery drill: what this plane does when the object store is wrong.

  Everything else in the suite measures a store that works. This namespace
  breaks it in the four ways superproject ADR-2608170400 P4-2 names — a pack
  that is gone, an index that will not parse, an object that ends early, and
  a range response that is not the range asked for — and pins what the store
  says about each.

  Measured on 2026-08-17 before any of it existed, all four were quiet or
  misdirected:

  | broken thing | what it did |
  |---|---|
  | middle pack deleted | returned the tip pack's 3 entries — same value as a healthy 1-pack store |
  | tip pack deleted | returned `[]` — same value as a zero budget, and as an empty store |
  | index corrupted | threw, discarding every pack already recovered, naming none of them |
  | object truncated | omitted the frames it could not reach, with every counter healthy |
  | store ignores Range | threw `car: unsupported CID version {:version 13217}` — blaming the pack for the store's bug |

  The first two are the shape this whole plane keeps finding: a thing that
  could not be measured returning the value of a thing that measured fine."
