  "The catalog on a real datom plane rather than an atom.

  `memory-catalog` is a map, and a map will agree with anything. The
  argument in ADR-2608160100 for putting the catalog on the datom plane is
  that it has to JOIN — with the pack that holds the block, and beyond this
  repository with the commit and the tenant. A test that never runs a query
  cannot tell whether that argument was implemented or just written down.

  `kotoba-lang/datalog` is the engine here and it is a TEST-ONLY dependency:
  the library ships the vocabulary, the quads and the queries, and composes
  over whichever datom store the caller already has."
